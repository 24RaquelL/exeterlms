    A favorite of politicians (and pretty much everybody else), this quote has been wrongly attributed to 
    Benjamin Franklin as well as—but there’s no evidence either of them said it. “The Ultimate Quotable Einstein,” 
    an authoritative complication of his most memorable utterances, identified the quote as a misattribution, and 
    mentioned its use in the 1983 novel “Sudden Death” by Rita Mae Brown. On his website, Quote Investigator, 
    O’Toole traced, the link between insanity and repetition back to at least the 19th century, but noted its use in a 
    Narcotics Anonymous pamphlet as well as novels (including Brown’s), TV shows and various other sources.
