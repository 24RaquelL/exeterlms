<h1>
Goal 1:
Leverage your knowledge of AJAX and jQuery to build a 
web page that allows you to change the content of the 
page on the click of a button.

You should have the following:

Header
Footer
Image

When the button is clicked, the content in each element should 
change(i.e. Image should change to another image etc..).    
</h1>

<h1>
Goal 2:
Leverage your knowledge of AJAX to create a web page that 
displays a famous historical figure with a header and a button 
when clicked displays more information about the historical figure.

For example:

If you chose Einstein, there should be:

A header with his name,
A picture of Einstein,
A button to "Learn More" and
A paragraph about Einstein that is displayed once the button is clicked.
This will require you to create a separate .txt file to 
store your information.
